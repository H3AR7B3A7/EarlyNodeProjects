This is a simple chat app using Node an socket.io I created following a youtube video.
The objective was to get a first experience with Node.<br>

This was an early introduction to Node and in no way represents what a real chat app should look like.

Special thanks to: Web Dev Simplified

## To start chat app

> npm run devStart

- Run a live server for the webpage
